</h3>

“Those pesky Government Accountability Office auditors checked out the data posted at [USAspending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/Pages/Default.aspx). Under the law, GAO is supposed to check things periodically. When it comes to budget data, agencies get about a “C.” GAO is 95 percent confident that three-quarters of the website data matches agency records. But on contracts and grants spending, forget about it. GAO found that between 0 and 1 percent of posted data matches agency records.”
