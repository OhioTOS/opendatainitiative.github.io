</h3>

“‘On May 9th, federal agencies will officially begin reporting data in compliance with the open standards created under the [Digital Accountability and Transparency Act](https://www.usaspending.gov/Pages/Data-Act.aspx), the landmark legislation that [cleared Congress in 2014](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2014/04/28/data-act-clears-congress/). (It’s called the 
[DATA Act](https://sunlightfoundation.com/taxonomy/term/data-act/”), for short, which is how we refer to it today.) The data will start flowing to [beta.usaspending.gov](http://beta.usaspending.gov/) in the coming days and will eventually be transitioned to [USAspending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/), the long term online home of federal spending data. ”
