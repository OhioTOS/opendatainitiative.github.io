</h3>

“‘On May 9th, federal agencies will officially begin reporting data in compliance with the open standards created under the <a href=”https://www.usaspending.gov/Pages/Data-Act.aspx”>Digital Accountability and Transparency Act</a>, the landmark legislation that <a href=”https://sunlightfoundation.com/2014/04/28/data-act-clears-congress/”>cleared Congress in 2014</a>. (It’s called the <a href=”https://sunlightfoundation.com/taxonomy/term/data-act/”>DATA Act</a>, for short, which is how we refer to it today.) The data will start flowing to <a href=”http://beta.usaspending.gov/”>beta.usaspending.gov</a> in the coming days and will eventually be transitioned to <a href=”https://www.usaspending.gov/”>USAspending.gov</a>, the long term online home of federal spending data. ”
