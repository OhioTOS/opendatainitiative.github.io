		<td colspan="2">Late summer 2017, we began investigating government financial transparency status quo by reviewing the US state open financial data and policies. From this research, we created our own transparency scorecard regarding the implementation of open data practices at the state level. </td>

        <li>no single pane of glass to view all data is in one online place</li>

    <td>Our Transparency Scorecard also informed us on policy at the state level
      <ul>
        <li>There are 34 states without a known or published finance open data policy. With more investigation, a policy may or may not be found. 9 of the 34, appear to have outsourced their finance open data policy to a technology contractor</li>
        <li>16 states have a some form of a published finance open data policy. The policy is either by Executive Order by the Governor (3) or by law enacted by the State Legislature (13)</li>
        <li>With more investigation working with policy experts, more state finance open data policy may be found. The information found so far was published by the state in some form online</li>
