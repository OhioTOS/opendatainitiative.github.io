From this research, we created our own transparency scorecard regarding the implementation of open data practices at the state level. </td>

        <li>no single pane of glass to view all data is in one online place</li>

    <td>Our Transparency Scorecard also informed us on policy at the state level
      <ul>
        <li>There are 34 states without a known or published finance open data policy. With more investigation, a policy may or may not be found. 9 of the 34, appear to have outsourced their finance open data policy to a technology contractor</li>
        <li>16 states have a some form of a published finance open data policy. The policy is either by Executive Order by the Governor (3) or by law enacted by the State Legislature (13)</li>
        <li>With more investigation working with policy experts, more state finance open data policy may be found. The information found so far was published by the state in some form online</li>
