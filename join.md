Thank you your interest. The Open Data Initiative works to ensure government finance data is consistent, transparent, and easily available. We need more people to join us in this effort. 

The Open Data Initiative was launched by Lincoln Network in partnership with the GFC foundation to improve public access to financial data. In addition to mere publication, it is essential that government data be published in a format that is usable and digestible. Given this, the mission of the Open Data Initiative is to find the current bottleneck preventing state and local governments from fulfilling this obligation and to subsequently provide the technological tools, skills, and expertise necessary to provide better access to government spending data.

We launched the first phase of the project over the summer of 2017, investigating the status quo. Our Lincoln Network staff began by scouring the contemporary literature on the subject and reaching out to organizations with a record of working on this issue. After informing ourselves and interacting with the individual state databases, we created our own scorecard regarding the implementation of open data practices at the state level.

Currently, we are talking to groups like the California Policy Center, the Data Coalition, and government officials about the financial transparancy problems that plague governments throughout the country. We want to understand your financial transparency interests, failures, and successes. Please complete this survey by answering your transparancy interests <https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/L9HS2S8>. 

If you would like to further participate by reviewing your financial transparency and/or joining a 2018 financial transparancy working group, please go to <http://wiki.opendatainitiative.io/.> For more immediate questions, email us at <join@opendatainitiative.io>
