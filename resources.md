# ODI Resources
<hr>
### <a>Cities</a>:
Our partner, the Sunlight Foundation, has been working on city open data for years, so there are many references to their resources here. This is a scaled down, stepwise version of the open data resources available from many sources. Find the full Sunlight Foundation <a target="_blank" href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/">Open Data Policy Guidelines here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://whatworkscities.sunlightfoundation.com/">Public Policy for Public Data Checklist here.</a>

### <a>States</a>:
State support of government financial transparency is critical for the success of the cities' open data implementations. Every city has financial reporting responsiblities to their state and likely to the <a target="_blank" href="http://gasb.org/">Governmental Accounting Standards Board</a>. This makes working with these critical oversight organziations an important part of every city's repsonsibilities. Each state's success with their own open data portals directly impacts their cities through standards, audits, reporting, and collaboration. The Open Data Initiative is working to bridge the gaps in government financial transparency implementations between the city, state, and federal levels.

### <a>US-Federal</a>:
Our partner, the Data Coalition, has been working to implement open data at the Federal level for years, so there are many references to their resources here. The people of the Data Coalition helped to pass the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.datacoalition.org/issues/data-act/">The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014</a> (DATA Act) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-113publ101/pdf/PLAW-113publ101.pdf">(PL 113-101)</a> which provided a example to the nation of the United States how government transparency could work on a large scale. This is a scaled down, stepwise version of the open data resources available from many sources.

		<a href="/legislation"><img src="/assets/img/legislation-icon.png" alt="ODI Open Data Legislation"></a>
		
		Many open data implementations are the result of good management and their policies. But any good policy can be modified by a change in management. To make good policy permanent, the policy must be made into a law. The law must cover just enough detail to establish a framework that the open data implementation can be built upon.
