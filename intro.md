# Intro

Lincoln Network's Open Data Initiative is an ongoing effort to establish a collaborative network of influencers focused on improving state financial checkbook standards.

Whereas previous data transparency efforts have largely focused on establishing a policy framework, our network of technology experts will audit implementation efforts across the states in order to help establish standards and best practices.

Our initial findings on state financial transparency practices and plans for the future will be briefly discussed at a reception corresponding with the State Policy Network Annual Conference in San Antonio, Texas at the JW Marriott Hill Country High Velocity Sports Bar August 30, 2017 at 5:30pm.
