# Mission

The Open Data Initiative was launched by Lincoln Network in partnership with the GFC foundation to improve public access to financial data. In addition to mere publication, it is essential that government data be published in a format that is usable and digestible. Given this, the mission of the Open Data Initiative is to find the current bottleneck preventing state and local governments from fulfilling this obligation and to subsequently provide the technological tools, skills, and expertise necessary to provide better access to government spending data.
